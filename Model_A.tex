\subsection{Model A}

\begin{frame}
  This model is based on Goldberg's model, and it contains assignments
  variables for all possible orders.

  The following assumptions are required in the model:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The probability that an adjuster is busy is $\rho$
    and is unaffected by the state of the system
  \item There is a strict ordering of the bases preferred for each zone
    that does not depend on the current state of the system. 
  \item All calls are answered by an adjuster originating from its base,
    not en route back to the base
  \item Different call types may have different service times
    and may or may not be included in the system objective function
  \item The arrival of calls to the system follows a stationary distribution
  \item The model is presented using a 0-queue assumption.
  \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
  Parameters:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $V$ the set of demand points, with $|V| = n$
  \item $W$ the set of possible site for adjusters/facilities, with $|W| = m$
  \item $p$ number of response adjusters
  \item $I$ the set of possible orders $\{1,2\ldots,p\}$
  \item $\rho$ is the utilization of each vehicle
  \item $t_{ij}$ is the expected travel time between zone \textit{i} and base \textit{j}.
  \item $h_{ij}^{k}$ is the probability that $j$ attend client $i$ given that
    is the kith preferred.
  \item $S_{ij}$ is $\{r\in W | t_{ir} < t_{ij}\}$
  \end{itemize}
  
  Variables:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $x_j 
    \begin{cases} 
      1 & \mbox{if there is and adjuster in node } j \\
      0 & \mbox{otherwise}
    \end{cases}$
  \item $y_{ij}^k 
    \begin{cases} 
      1 & \mbox{if the adjuster in } j \mbox{, is the k-th to cover the node }i \\
      0 & \mbox{otherwise}
  \end{cases}$
  \end{itemize}
