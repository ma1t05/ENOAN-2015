\begin{frame}
  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The Model A was formulated, that is an linear approximation to the SQpM
  \item We noticed that the Model A, is difficult to solve for instances of small size
  \item The Model B was formulated, another linear approximation to the SQpM
  \item For small enough values of $\ell$, Model B can be solved relatively quick
    for instances of medium size
  \item The solutions obtained from the Model B for small values of $\ell$
    approximates well the solutions of Model A,
    as well as self solutions for large values of $\ell$
  \end{itemize}
